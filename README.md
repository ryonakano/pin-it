- Automatically save everythingâ€•your data in editing, last open view, and preferences

The original idea of the app is inspired from https://github.com/alexkdeveloper/dfc.

## Installation
### For Users
You can download the app from Flathub, which should make this app available for all Linux distribution:

[<img src="https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.svg" width="160" alt="Download on Flathub">](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.ryonakano.pinit)

We originally targeted this app for elementary OS and also released it on Flathub after some time, but **we decided to publish the app only on Flathub since version `2.0.0`. We no longer publish new features or bug fixes to the elementary-curated version of the app.**

This does not mean the app no longer available on elementary OS. You can simply switch to the Flathub version of the app; please uninstall the current installation and then re-install the app from Flathub.

### For Developers
You'll need the following dependencies to build:

* libgee-0.8-dev
* libgtk-4-dev
* libadwaita-1-dev (>= 1.2.0)
* meson (>= 0.57.0)
* valac

Run `meson build` to configure the build environment. Change to the build directory and run `ninja` to build

    meson build --prefix=/usr
    cd build
    ninja

To install, use `ninja install`, then execute with `com.github.ryonakano.pinit`

    ninja install
    com.github.ryonakano.pinit
